tms: Test Match Special
=======================

tms lets you test values in test code, where you may not be able to test
against an exact, known value.

Some quick examples:

Test an object's class and instance attributes::

    assert zoo.get('elephant') == tms.InstanceOf(Elephant, name='nelly')

Match data structures::

    assert resultset.any() == {'id': tms.InstanceOf(int),
                               'name': tms.Contains('bob'),
                               'data': tms.Anything()}

Common types have shortcuts, eg::

    tms.Bool()
    tms.Str()
    tms.Unicode()
    tms.Bytes()
    tms.Int()
    tms.Float()

Test for in / not in::

    assert 'business' == tms.Contains('sin')
    assert 'my lunch' == tms.DoesntContain('nuts')

Test attributes::

    assert Circle(1) == tms.InstanceOf(Circle, radius=1)

    assert Circle(1) == tms.InstanceOf(Circle, radius=tms.InstanceOf(int))

    assert Circle(1) == tms.InstanceOf(Circle, has_attrs=['radius'])


Test for arbitrary conditions::

    assert 1 == tms.Int(lambda x: x > 0)
    assert Circle(1) == tms.InstanceOf(Circle, lambda x: x.radius == 1)


Test dictionaries or dict-like objects::

    # Check that it contains keys and values
    assert {'x': 1} == tms.DictLike(x=1)

    # Check that it contains certain keys
    assert dict(x=1, y=2) == tms.Contains('x', 'y')

    # Check that it doesn't contain certain keys
    assert dict(x=1, y=2) == tms.DoesntContain('foo', 'bar')


Combining tests::

    assert mylunch == tms.InstanceOf(Sandwich) & tms.DoesntContain(cheese)


Unlike `hamcrest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyHamcrest>`_, tms uses the
``__eq__`` method to evaluate comparisons. This means it works with python's
built in assert statement. This also means it works well with other test
libraries: you can drop a ``tms.Matcher`` object into any regular equality
test and have it work.

Note that this also means that it may not work for objects that override
the __eq__ method. If the matcher doesn't seem to be firing, try putting it on
the left hand side of the comparison::

    >>> import tms
    >>> class MySpecialObject(object):
    ...     def __eq__(self, other):
    ...         return False
    ...
    >>> MySpecialObject() == tms.Anything()
    False
    >>> tms.Anything() == MySpecialObject()
    True


CHANGELOG
=========

0.1.2 (released 2015-09-01)
---------------------------

- Added shortcuts for common builtin types, so you can now write ``tms.Int()``
  instead of ``tms.InstanceOf(int)``.

- Added ``tms.Passes``. This takes an arbitrary function that is expected
  to return a boolean,
  eg ``assert random.randrange(1, 3) == tms.Passes(lambda x: 1 <= x < 3)``.
  This is integrated with ``tms.InstanceOf`` and ``tms.Anything``,
  so you can write eg
  ``tms.InstanceOf(MyClass, lambda x: x.name.startswith('foo'))``.

0.1.1
-----

- Initial release
